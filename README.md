# planet-builder

Web experiece created for the NASA Space Apps challenge 2019.

# What it is about

This is a web experience that allow users to create exoplanets configuring some of their main characteristics. When they finish creating the exoplanet, we show a similar actual exoplated discovered by NASA.
For this we created a [web service](https://github.com/Space-Apps-2019-Trisolarians-Team/planet-builder-api) that wraps the data provided by NASA.

# Technology used
